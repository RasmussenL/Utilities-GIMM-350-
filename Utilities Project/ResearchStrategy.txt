My current research strategy is fairly simple. I usually type in plain, perhaps slightly general terms of what I need. If I need examples of how to track the nearest enemy in unity Iâ€™ll type something like Unity find enemy. Then I try to choose results from Unity or Windows Resources, followed by stack overflow. After that I will consult other forums for more specific issues, understanding that I might not get exactly what I want.
I definitely ran into some walls while doing research for this project. I think I would get strange issues then not find anything related when I look them up. I think the general thing that helped me figure things out is try to do my best to diagnose the actual problem before I go to google. Sometimes if you take a closer look at an error, it will give you some insight as to what is going wrong in your program. I also learned that when you are researching topics related to oculus, you have to be specific in certain ways. When I searched for oculus related issues I generally had to use "unity oculus" at the begining to get useful results. When my hands weren't showing up in my build for the game, searching "unity oculus hands missing on build" didn't yield anything, but "unity oculus avatar missing on build" did. So generally:
1.Fully Identify the issue
2.Type the program or language you are using
3.use specific but general terms
