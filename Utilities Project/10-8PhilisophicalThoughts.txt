I am having a hard time engaing with the book fully, and I think that it might have to do with semantic definitions of games. I think that, historical, a large commercial product video game as we know it has general been a poor venue to deliver a thought experiment. I think that with mechanics driven entertainment, murder is the easiest thing to do because developers know how to make that fun, but in tern, that makes a lot of the philisophical decisions boil down to "do you want to murder or not murder?". I acknowlege that there is great potential in interactive media to deliver a thought experiment that's more engaging than something written, but video games as we know them now might be a poor avenue to do that. I think that one could make an affective simulation of the trolley problem on it's own, but i doubt that it would have the same moral complexity if I threw the same idea at the latest Call of Duty. Outside of this holdup however, I do buy into the idea of virtualy reality being effectively real and some other points discussed in the book.
